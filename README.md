# Ekatar
 In E - क़तार we are trying to digitize big OPD lines of hospitals. We aim to get users an estimated time in which their turn comes and they can book an OPD slip even before arriving at hospital and can manage their time well. No more waiting in line for countless hours before your turn comes, you can show up just before your turn.
